Kadicon is a Minecraft Classic 0.30 server written in V.
> [!CAUTION]
> This project is created mostly to train myself to use V and have my own Minecraft Classic server software, and I do not guarantee any progress or working code; neither do I guarantee that I will actively work on this.

## Current State
Currently, all client -> server packets functionality have been implemented, providing correct and stable behavior.

## Future plans
I plan on maybe adding additional features just for the sake of it. No promises, though.

## How To Use
Simply launch the binary. It will create a server.properties file which you can modify.

## How To Compile
Simply run this command:
```
v .
```
And it should compile Kadicon into a binary ready to be executed.

## Why Bother Doing This ?
A great man once said, "Science isn't about why, science is about why not !".
